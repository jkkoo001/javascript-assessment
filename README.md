# javascript-assessment

1) What did you like about this project?
   It was fun/challenging to work on and allowed me to practise on how to apply the JavaScript concepts that I have learned so far.
    
2) What did you struggle with in this project?
   I struggled with generating random holes and coming up with the right statements to check the various conditions of the game. Without the guided steps/tasks and helping codes from the assessment doc, I might not be able to complete this project.
